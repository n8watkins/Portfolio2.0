## Quick Commands

### Continue Refactoring:
```bash
# Step 1: Integrate ImageSlider (Phase 3.2)
# Manually edit components/Projects.tsx to:
# - Remove lines 16-281 (ImageSlider component)
# - Add: import ImageSlider from './Projects/ImageSlider'
# - Update ImageSlider usage to include projectTitle and projectId props

# Step 2: Test
npm run type-check
npm run build

# Step 3: Commit
git add components/Projects.tsx
git commit -m "Phase 3.2: Integrate extracted ImageSlider component"
```

### Extract Next Component (Phase 4):
```bash
# Create ProjectModal component
# Extract lines 289-405 from Projects.tsx to components/Projects/ProjectModal.tsx
# Update imports
# Test and commit
```

## Notes

- **All Phase 0 fixes are applied and tested** ✅
- **ImageSlider is extracted but not yet integrated** 🚧
- **No breaking changes so far** ✅
- **Build still passes** ✅

## If You Need to Stop

Current state is **safe to stop**:
- All commits are clean
- Phase 0 fixes improve code quality immediately
- ImageSlider extraction is committed (can be integrated later)
- No broken builds
- Can resume anytime from Phase 3.2
